# Hardtack
Hardtack mod for HSK. This mod adds a new building unlocked from the bakery research, the Bread Oven. You can make hardtack which is a long lasting food intended for survival or traveling primarily. They can even be baked multiple times to prolong their shelf life at the cost of becoming much more unpleasant to eat and less nutritious.  

# I am not a modder
Calling me any sort of amateur modder/coder/programmer would be a huge compliment. I am none of these, don't expect anything incredible.
