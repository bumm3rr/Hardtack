Brand new mod, still need to figure out balancing. Mainly worried about nutrition, ease of production, cost of the recipes.

Not sure how much bulk/mass it should have. Just need to play with it more.

Figure out how to make the Bread Oven collapse into the Architect > Production > Prepare Food menu instead of being a separate button in the Production menu.
